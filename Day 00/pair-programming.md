# Collaborating with your Fellow Coders! 

One of the biggest advantages of being in a classroom setting is the network of fellow developers you build. You are in a safe space to make mistakes, learn how to talk through your code, talk through your thought processes out loud, and practice what it’s like to explain your code and work through problems with a team before you’re in an interview or in the workplace! 

Additionally, your fellow coders will also become hiring managers and employees of companies looking for more developers in the future. Now is the perfect time to get to know each other! 


## What is Pair Programming? 
Pair programming is a technique often used in [agile development](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/) where 2 coders work together on a single computer. There is a **Driver** and a **Navigator**. 

Why do this? Because two heads are better than one! By pairing with a fellow coder, you are able to focus your attention on one piece of the puzzle. Both the Driver and Navigator are crucial! Together, both coders will learn from each other and complete a better overall project. 

### Driver: 
* Focus on completing the current task.
* Talk through your thought process out loud.

### Navigator: 
* Help catch bugs and typos
* Think about potential future improvements 
* Think about issues to address for efficiency 
* Think about how to refactor the code in the future
* Use documentation to find resources to help the driver get past a hurdle

Be sure to switch back and forth between roles as you work through features and communicate out loud while you work through problems together. 


## Online Collaboration
So this all seems simple to do in person, but how do you work collaboratively online? 

### Here’s your basic toolkit: 

* **Slack**
    * Using Slack, you can send each other small snippets of code, helpful links to resources, and more! 
* **Zoom**
    * Using your Zoom accounts, you can talk to each other out loud, [share your screen](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362153-How-Do-I-Share-My-Screen-), [annotate](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115005706806-Annotation-as-a-Viewer) on each other’s screens to point out specific areas, and you can [record](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362473-Local-Recording) your sessions to review them later!  
    * Please note that with your Free License, [your meeting will time out at 40 minutes](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/202460676-Will-My-Meeting-Time-Out-). Just join the session again after it ends to continue collaborating! 
* **GitHub**
    * Use GitHub repositories to add each other as collaborators for group projects or side projects! 
    * Use the branches to build specific features during your collaboration sessions and merge them into master once they’re working.
